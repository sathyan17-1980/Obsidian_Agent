## Series Coherence

### Part 1 → Part 2 Flow
- **Part 1 Conclusion:** "Next week, we'll explore backpropagation—how networks learn from their mistakes and adjust their weights to improve predictions."
- **Part 2 Opening:** "Last week we learned how neural networks transform data through forward propagation—but that was only half the story."

### Complete Learning Cycle Coverage
1. **Part 1 (Forward Propagation):**
   - Input data → Weighted sums → Activation functions → Output predictions
   - Weights and biases as learnable parameters
   - Layer-wise transformation and hierarchical representations
   - AGOP formula for automatic feature learning

2. **Part 2 (Backpropagation):**
   - Loss calculation → Gradient computation → Weight updates
   - Backpropagation using chain rule
   - Vanishing gradient solutions (ReLU, batch norm, ResNets)
   - Modern optimizers (Adam, SGD with momentum)
   - Regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization)

### Technical Continuity
- Part 1 explained **forward propagation**: `output = activation(weights × inputs + bias)`
- Part 2 explained **backpropagation**: `new_weight = old_weight - (learning_rate × gradient)`
- Together: Complete training loop from prediction to learning
