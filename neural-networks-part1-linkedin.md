# Neural Networks Part 1: LinkedIn Post

As promised last week, here is the continuation to my AI series on vector databases. Last week we explored how vector databases store and search embeddings; this week, I'm taking you deeper into Neural Networks - the foundation that makes all of this possible.

You may wonder, why neural networks, or how do these systems actually learn from data? That is because neural networks are the engine behind every AI application you use today.

So what is a neural network? In a nutshell, it's a computational system inspired by biological neurons that learns patterns from data through layers of mathematical transformations. A typical network has an input layer (where data enters), hidden layers (where learning happens), and an output layer (where predictions emerge).

Let's look at a concrete example: handwritten digit recognition. When you feed a 28×28 pixel image (784 numbers) into a neural network, each pixel value flows through layers of neurons. A simple network might have 784 input neurons → 128 hidden neurons → 10 output neurons (one for each digit 0-9). That's 100,352 total connections, each with a learned weight!

The speed is amazing: a trained network classifies digits in milliseconds. This is due to matrix multiplication - transforming 784 inputs through weighted connections in a single mathematical operation.

Why this matters for you:
Neural networks power every modern AI system - from ChatGPT understanding your questions to recommendation engines suggesting products. Understanding how they learn from data is the difference between using pre-built models and architecting custom solutions for your specific problems.

And the best part? There are tons of free resources. 3Blue1Brown's Neural Networks series offers exceptional visual explanations that make the math intuitive.

Even if you're just starting with AI, understanding neural networks will help you grasp why certain architectures work better than others. Excited to delve deeper? In next week's post (Part 2), I will explain how backpropagation trains these networks through gradient descent.
