# LinkedIn Post - Neural Networks Part 1

My friends have often asked me to share my learnings on AI and how these systems actually work. So I'm starting this two-part series on neural networks, taking you progressively through the fundamentals that power everything from ChatGPT to image recognition.

You may wonder, how do neural networks actually learn from data, or what makes them different from traditional programming? That is because they don't follow pre-programmed rules—they discover patterns themselves.

So what is a neural network? Think of it as layers of mathematical operations where data flows forward through neurons. Each neuron performs a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias, then applies an activation function. As researchers at UC San Diego recently discovered, neural networks learn through a formula called Average Gradient Outer Product (AGOP), which explains how they detect relevant patterns in data and focus on what matters.

Here's the magic: during forward propagation, when you show a network an image, it transforms that raw pixel data through multiple layers. According to Google's Machine Learning Crash Course, "Neural networks learn the relationship between images and their labels and extract data patterns, or features, that they need to focus on." For example, in recognizing glasses, the network automatically learns to pay attention to the upper part of a face—without anyone programming that rule.

Why this matters for you: Understanding how networks learn from data is the difference between using AI tools and architecting AI solutions. This means you can build systems that automatically improve with more data, handle tasks impossible to code manually, and adapt to new patterns without reprogramming.

And the best part? You can start experimenting right now. Google's Machine Learning Crash Course offers free hands-on tutorials that walk you through building your first neural network in under 2 hours.

Excited to delve deeper? In next week's post (Part 2), I will explain how backpropagation and gradient descent actually update those weights to minimize errors and train deep networks.
